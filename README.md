# CNN Image Classification

## Objective
To build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow.

## Description
This project uses a CNN model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model learns visual patterns such as edges and shapes and predicts the correct class for each image.

## Dataset
Fashion MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images of clothing items).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## Model Details
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected (Dense) layers
- Softmax output layer

## Output
- Training and validation accuracy
- Test accuracy on unseen data
